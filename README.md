The main purpose of this is to demonstrate the use of Third Party APIs and local storage to create a day planner.<p>
By utilizing Moment JS, once can display the current day and time at the top of the page and format the page to change css classes to show if your tasks have been missed or not throughout the day<p>

Once the user enters in the desired task in the hour, the button to the right saves it into local storage.<p>
When the page is refreshed, it should still show the same task until changed.<p>
CSS classes to display colors are constantly updated on the page in real time, not through button press or local storage.
